This project is a 3D Solar System simulation built using the Three.js library. It visualizes the Sun and all eight planets in a dynamic, interactive environment. The entire solar system is rendered in a web browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the need for a backend. Each planet has realistic textures and orbits the Sun in circular motion, controlled by predefined orbit radius and revolution speed values. A space-themed skybox surrounds the scene, creating an immersive outer space experience. The user can interact with the 3D scene using OrbitControls, allowing rotation, zoom, and pan with the mouse. The Sun is placed at the center and acts as a point light, illuminating all planets. The camera is positioned at a suitable distance to provide a complete view of the solar system and adapts responsively to the browser window size.

The scene is initialized using the init() function, which sets up the Three.js environment, including the camera, renderer, light source, skybox, and planets. A reusable function createPlanet() generates spheres with specific textures for each celestial body. Planets are initially positioned along the x-axis and animated in the animate() loop using trigonometric functions to simulate orbital movement around the Sun. The animation runs continuously at ~60fps using requestAnimationFrame.

Technologies used in this project include Three.js (for 3D rendering), JavaScript ES6 (for logic and interactivity), HTML5 and CSS3 (for structure and styling), OrbitControls (for camera interaction), and WebGL (as the rendering engine). The project is fully frontend-based and can be run directly by opening the index.html file in a browser. However, due to browser restrictions on loading textures via JavaScript, it is recommended to run the project through a local web server (e.g., using python -m http.server) for best performance.

The folder structure includes the main HTML and CSS files, a js directory containing the main JavaScript logic (main.js), and an img directory that holds planet textures and six skybox images. Each texture is mapped onto spherical geometry to realistically represent each planet. Custom orbit radius and speed settings are applied to each one, and these can be modified inside the JavaScript file to change the animation behavior.

This project is a great learning tool for beginners in computer graphics, astronomy visualizations, or Three.js development. Potential improvements could include adding moons, spinning planet rotation, orbit lines, planet labels, or a control panel for adjusting speed and zoom. It is free to use and open-source under the MIT License.
